      h1.open-sans Titanic Sinks Four Hours After Hitting Iceberg
      article.article-med.article-col-2
        p.arvo CAPE RACE, N.F., April 15. &ndash; The White Star liner Olympic reports by wireless this evening that the Cunarder Carpathia reached, at daybreak this morning, the position from which wireless calls for help were sent out last night by the Titanic after her collision with an iceberg. The Carpathia found only the lifeboats and the wreckage of what had been the biggest steamship afloat.
        p.arvo The Titanic had foundered at about 2:20 A.M., in latitude 41:46 north and longitude 50:14 west. This is about 30 minutes of latitude, or about 34 miles, due south of the position at which she struck the iceberg. All her boats are accounted for and about 655 souls have been saved of the crew and passengers, most of the latter presumably women and children. There were about 1,200 persons aboard the Titanic.
        p.arvo The Leyland liner California is remaining and searching the position of the disaster, while the Carpathia is returning to New York with the survivors.
        p.arvo It can be positively stated that up to 11 o'clock to-night nothing whatever had been received at or heard by the Marconi station here to the effect that the Parisian, Virginian or any other ships had picked up any survivors, other than those picked up by the Carpathia.

      .article-small
        p.lora <span>L</span>ora was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in it, `and what is the use of a book,' thought Lora `without pictures or conversation?'
        p.lora So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.
        p.lora There was nothing so <em>very</em> remarkable in that; nor did Lora think it so <em>very</em> much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, `Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be late!' (when she thought it over afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually <em>took a watch out of its waistcoat-pocket</em>, and looked at it, and then hurried on, Lora started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.

      .article-small
        p.lato On January 8, Tom Hansen meets Lato Finn, the new assistant to his boss. Tom is trained as an architect but works as a writer at a greeting card company in Los Angeles. Following a karaoke night, Tom's friend and co-worker McKenzie reveals that Tom is attracted to Lato. During the next few months Lato and Tom grow closer, despite Lato's telling Tom that she does not believe in true love, and does not want a boyfriend.
        p.lato Tom shows Lato his favorite spot in the city, which overlooks a number of buildings he likes, although the view is spoiled by parking lots. After several months of dating, Tom gets into a fight with a man who flirts with Lato, and they have their first argument. On day 290, Lato and Tom end their relationship after they see The Graduate, a film by which Lato is visibly moved, but by which Tom is unaffected. Tom does not take the breakup well, and Tom's friends call his younger sister, Rachel, to calm him down.
